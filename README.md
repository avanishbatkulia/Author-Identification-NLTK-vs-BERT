# Author-Identification-NLTK-vs-BERT
This project compares traditional NLP methods using NLTK with modern deep learning models, specifically Hugging Face's BERT, for the task of author identification. The dataset includes text samples from three classic authors: Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, and William Shakespeare.
We explore how well each method performs in identifying the authorship of text passages, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of traditional vs. modern approaches in natural language processing.

Key Features:

Data: Text excerpts from Dickens, Austen, and Shakespeare.
Models:
Traditional approach using NLTK for feature extraction and classification.
Modern approach using pretrained BERT models from Hugging Face.
Comparison: Accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability between traditional and deep learning models.
